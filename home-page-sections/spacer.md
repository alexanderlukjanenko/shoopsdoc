## Spacer

&#x20;You can set your own space in the settings of the “Spacer” section. In this section you have 4 scales from 0 to 100 pixels, where you can set the needed space. These scales are **“Margin top”** - sets the size of the spacer from its top, **“Margin bottom”** - sets the size of the spacer from its bottom, **“Mobile margin top”** - sets the mobile size of the spacer from its top, **“Mobile margin bottom”** - sets the mobile size of the spacer from its bottom. If on the mobile scales you set 0, the desktop settings will apply to the mobile version.\
&#x20;This section allows one to set the content width for the separator. It may be either **“Full”** or **“Boxed”**. You can also enable the option **“Show separator”** if you want to have a line, that separates the content sections. You can add a **Title** for this section and it will be displayed on the home page, e.g.: “A Great About Us”:
