## Gallery

&#x20;This section allows one to set the content width for the gallery. It may be either **“Full”** or **“Boxed”**. If you enable the option **“Enable masonry”** the gallery images will not have fixed height rows:

## Item

&#x20;In this section, you can add content to your gallery by adding the blocks **"Item"**. You can add as many “Item” blocks in the content as you wish. It depends on how many images you want to have in your gallery.&#x20;

&#x20;You can choose the size of the image proportion to the gallery row on the **“Size”** scale from 1 to 12, add a new **“Image”** that should be displayed in the gallery, and change its size on the **“Image size”** scale from 200 to 1000px. There are two fields for the text lines **“Text line #1 - #2”**, which you may add to the gallery image. This text will be shown on the image when it is hovered over with the mouse:

&#x20;The gallery popup will be shown by clicking on an image, both on desktop and mobile view:
