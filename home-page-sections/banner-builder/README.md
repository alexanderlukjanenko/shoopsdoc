{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/collections\_product grid.png>)

The option **“Size of the columns on mobile”** allows you to set the number of items in the row on mobile: “1 item in the row” or “2 items in the row”. In the dropdown list of **“Margins for the columns”**, you can choose the type of the margins for the columns.
