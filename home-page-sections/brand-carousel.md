**Add section -> Brand carousel**
{% endhint %}

## Brand carousel

### Title

&#x20; You can add a **Title** for this section and it will be displayed on the home page, e.g.: “Brands”.

## General

### Layout

&#x20;Here you can choose how the brand’s content should be positioned as a grid or as a slider.

### Size of the columns

&#x20;In **“Size of the columns”** you can decide how many brands should be shown in one row. Simply choose the needed option from the dropdown list. This option works only for the layout “Slider”.

### Image max width

&#x20;Here you have a scale from 0 to 200 px, where you can set the size of the brand’s images.

### Bordered links

&#x20;If you enable this option the bordered links will be displayed on the brands, when one hovers over them with the mouse.&#x20;

&#x20;The radius of the bordered links can be changed in **“Border radius (px, %)”** from the sharp to round ones. Simply type the value in pixels or in percent.

## Slider Settings <a href="#slider-settings" id="slider-settings"></a>

&#x20;Here you can enable an **“Autoplay”** for the brand’s sliders and set its speed on the **“Autoplay speed (sec)”** scale from 2 to 10 seconds. You can also choose whether **Arrows** or **Bullets** should be displayed when the brands change, simply by enabling one or all of these options. If you enable **“Is infinite”** , the brand’s carousel will be infinite. If you disable this option, the carousel will stop, once it shows the last brand.

## Brand <a href="#content" id="content"></a>

&#x20;In this section you can add content for the “Brand carousel”. Simply click on **“Select Image”** and you will be able to add the brand image and to paste the **link** (optional) to which the customers should be redirected when clicking on this brand:&#x20;
