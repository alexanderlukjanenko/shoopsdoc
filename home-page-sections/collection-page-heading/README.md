  If you need to have a Heading on collection pages, the section “Collection
  page heading” should be added. Heading is a content which is displayed before
  or after the collection products grid.

# Collection page heading

{% hint style="info" %}
**Add section -> Collection page heading**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT!** This section required to save changes by pressing “Save” button in order to view customizations on a collection page.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;This content can be added several times and in different content blocks: “Title”, “Promo box (banner)”, “Slick slider”, or “Slide for slick.&#x20;

## Heading

&#x20;In this section, you can configure the general settings regarding the title and content for the “Heading”. These settings will be applied for all collections on your store. There are 4 dropdown lists for this purpose: **“Position”**, **“Default desktop title”** and **“Default mobile title”**, **“Margins for the columns”**.&#x20;

&#x20;In the **“Position”** drop-down, one can decide where and how the content should be shown on a collection page: “Products grid width”, “Container & top”, “Fullwidth & top”, “Container & bottom” or “Fullwidth & bottom”.

&#x20;For **“Default desktop title”** and **“Default mobile title”**, you can decide whether only title, title with the description, only description, or nothing out of this should be displayed. In the **“Margins for the columns”**, you can choose the type of the margins for the columns.

&#x20;This is how a collection page may look like when one enables “Products grid width” and “Only description” for desktop mode:
