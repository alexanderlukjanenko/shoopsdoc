  If you want to have a static section on your pages where the products from
  some collection will be displayed, you need to add a section “Collections”.
---

# Collections

{% hint style="info" %}
**Add section -> Collections**
{% endhint %}

## Collections

&#x20;Here you can decide how many products should be shown in one row by selecting the proper option from the dropdown list in the **“Size of the columns”**. On the **“Max count”** scale from 1 to 24 products you can choose the maximum number of the products that should be shown from the collection. Tick the option **“Show button 'See all products'“** if such need arises.

## Collection

&#x20;In order to have something shown in this section, you need to add a collection as a content for this section. Simply click on **“Add Collection”** and select the proper collection from the list. How to create and edit your collections you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections)**.** You can add as many collections as you want. The customers will be able to check them all by clicking on their titles. If you have not written any title for the collection in the **“Title”** , the name of the collection that you have selected will be displayed as its title automatically.

&#x20;In our example we have added 2 collections “Sale” and “Men’s”:

&#x20; If the customer should be redirected to the selected collection to view all products in this collection, enable an option **“Show button 'See all products'”**.

&#x20;This is how it may look like on your store:
