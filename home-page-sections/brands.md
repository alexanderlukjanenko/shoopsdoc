{% endhint %}

## Brands

&#x20;Here you can decide if to display a title for the section. If you need a title to be shown, simply type it in the **“Title”**.

## Content

&#x20;In the **“Section type”** dropdown, one can select if to display brands as a text or text with an image. If you need to display the image, choose the second variant **“With image”** and press “Select image” in the **“Default image for "With image" type”.  Please note,** this image will be applied for all brands. The image height can be changed on the **“Image height”** scale from 30 to 150.

&#x20; If you work only with the PJPG image format and the transparent images with the formats GIF or PNG shouldn’t be allowed in your store, enable the option **“Enable format “PJPG”**.

&#x20; In the **“Alphabet”** you can write the alphabet letters, that will be displayed in an alphabetical listing on the top of this section. The items should be separated by ','.&#x20;

&#x20;If you need to display your list of brands and not all brands in your store, fill in the **“Custom list of brands”** field. The items can be split by breaking the line.

## Brand

&#x20;In this block, you can create and apply settings for a new brand, or customize each existing brand separately. In the **“Block type”** you can choose the brand to which this block should be assigned: a new brand or existing one.

&#x20;In the **“Brand name”**, type the name of the brand.  In order to add a brand logo of suppliers/manufactures, select a logo in the **“Image”**. The link address can be added in the **“Link”** filed to redirect customers to the needed page.

&#x20;Here you can add a link to collection and filter by brand. You need to add a new filter **“Vendor”** in _Shopify admin-> Online store -> Navigation -> Collection and search filters,_ for link filtering to work:

&#x20;The link format: {collection link}?filter.p.vendor={Brand}

**Example:** [https://shella-demo.myshopify.com/collections/all?filter.p.vendor=Prada](https://shella-demo.myshopify.com/collections/all?filter.p.vendor=Prada)

&#x20;This is how the brands section may look like, if to add six “Brand” blocks with an image for each one and to enable the option “With image” in the “Brands” section:
