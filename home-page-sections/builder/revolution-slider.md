## Revolution Slider

&#x20; Here you can choose what kind of slide transitions it will be. This is the main difference between the “Revolution Slider” and “Slick Slider”. One can set the time of the speed, with which the sliders will be changed. In order to have such an effect on your page, **you need to add a block “Revolution Slider” first and then add blocks “Slide for Revolution”**, where you can select the images for the sliders and customize them. The number of “Slide for Revolution” blocks depends on the number of slides you want to have.

### Layout

&#x20;Here you can choose the height of the image from the dropdown list of the **“Height”**. The **“Minimum height”** and **“Image height size”** can be set on the scale from 0 to 1000px. The size of the columns can be chosen from the dropdown list **“Size of the column”**. The sliders have **Arrows** or **Bullets**, which help to navigate to the next or to the previous slider. You can choose either one of them, both of them or none for your sliders. One can also decide how often the sliders should be changed by the next ones using the **“Delay (seconds)”** scale from 3 to 15 seconds.  If you need the parallax effects for the image or its content, you may set it on the **“Parallax of the image”** scale from 0 to 16 and on the **“Parallax of content”** scale from 0 to 16. If you enable the option **“Preload spacer”**, the space for the “Builder” section, where the “Revolution Slider” is built-in will be removed for ca. 2-3 seconds while the store page will be loading. Once the page is loaded the whole block will be displayed again.

### General

&#x20;In this section you can add a URL for the slide that will redirect your customers to the needed page, when clicking on the slider. Simply click on it and choose the desired page from the dropdown list, or you can paste a link that is not on this list.

### Image

&#x20;You can add an image both for a desktop and a mobile version. The recommended image size is 1440 x 550 pixels. For the mobile version you can set the horizontal position using a **“Horizontal position for the mobile image”** scale from 0 to 100%, where 50% is a center position, 0% - move to the left, 100% - move to the right. The settings will be disabled if you choose “Auto image adaptation height” in Layouts -> Height, which will come further in the settings.

### Text

&#x20;Here you can customize the text content for your slide. There are 3 text lines that can be added. Delete the line value for the text or button if you want to hide the element and use "\<br>" for a line break. Of course the style of the text content can be changed in **“Colorized style”**, where you can choose one of eight possible styles for this purpose.

### Button #1 - #2

&#x20;For each banner in the promo box you can add two buttons, which can be customized. There are three customization options for the buttons: **Button text, URL for the button**, and **Button style**. In the **Button text** you can write the title of the button, e.g.: Shop now, or More. In the **URL for the button** insert the link to which the client should be redirected when clicking on the button and in the **Button style** you can choose one of the button styles which are offered in the dropdown list.

### Other content

#### Custom HTML

&#x20;This option allows you to replace the whole text content in the promo box with the page content. How to add and edit a page you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page)**.**

### Video

&#x20;If you want to have a video on your Home page, you can add it here. If this is a YouTube or Vimeo link, you can simply insert it in **“YouTube or Vimeo video URL”**. If the source of the video is different, you can upload it in _Shopify Admin-> Settings-> Files_ and add a link here. Once you have uploaded the video, copy its URL and paste in **“Video URL”**. You can also decide whether the video should have an autoplay or a control, simply by enabling or disabling such options like **“Video autoplay”** and **“Video controls”**.

### Layout
