  If you need to have a space for  “Header type” #5 and “Header type” #7
  (vertical menu), a block “Space for vertical menu” should be added.

# Space for vertical menu

{% hint style="info" %}
**Add section -> Builder -> Space for vertical menu**
{% endhint %}

&#x20; When you add a block “Space for vertical menu”, the vertical menu in the “Header type” #5 and “Header type” #7 will have it's own space for the dropdown or for the fixed vertical menu. Otherwise the menu will be over the other content on the home page.&#x20;

### Menu

&#x20;Once you click on “Space for vertical menu” a new block will appear, where you will need to select the menu. Make sure, that this block is on the very top, over all other blocks in the content section. It can be dragged when clicking on default Shopify symbol and reordered to the needed place.
