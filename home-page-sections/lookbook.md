&#x20;It was added the manual filling of the product block (**“Product image”, “Product title”, “Product price”, “Product compare at price”**) for those products that cannot be displayed due to 20 product’s limit. This information can be changed for each product up to limit.

&#x20;On the **“Horizontal position”** and **“Vertical position”** scales from 0 to 100% you can order the position of the products displayed on the image. The products will be shown as dots at which one can click and see the product details. This option is available for the **“Layout #1”** only.

&#x20;This is how the "Look book" section may look like on your Home page:
