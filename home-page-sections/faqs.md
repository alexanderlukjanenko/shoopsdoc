# FAQs

{% hint style="info" %}
**Add section -> FAQs**
{% endhint %}

&#x20;Here you can add sections for each FAQ and decide how to represent its answer, either as a page or as a text, which you will write manually. Let’s take a look at this section.\
&#x20;In the field **“Question”** you can write a question to which you will provide the answer. You can select a page in the **“Page content for the answer”**. If no page is selected, the default page “Include FAQs Answer” will be used. How to add and edit a page you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page). You may use the field **“Answer”** to write the answer manually. If you want your FAQ answer to be shown as open, you can enable the option **“Is open”**.

&#x20;In our example, we have added 2 “Section” blocks and this is what we have got:
