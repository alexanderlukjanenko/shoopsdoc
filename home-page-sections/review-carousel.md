### Size of the columns

&#x20;In **“Size of the columns”** you can decide how many reviews should be shown in one row. You can show from 1 to 4 items in a row. Simply choose the needed option from the dropdown list.

&#x20;Enable an **“Autoplay”** for the review’s sliders and set its speed on the **“Autoplay speed (sec)”** scale from 2 to 10 seconds. You can also enable **“Arrows”** to be displayed when the reviews change.

## Slide

&#x20;In order to have a review content, you need to click on **“Add Slide”** and a new content block will be ready for the customization. Here you will have some fields that should be filled in with the content you want to be displayed: **Title, Paragraph, User text line #1, User text line #2.** On the **“Stars”** scale from 1 to 5, you can choose how many stars should be displayed in the review. In **“User image”,** select the image of the user, who gives a review. We have added 4 content blocks and this is what we have got:
