# Theme Blocks

{% hint style="info" %}
**Sections -> Footer - Add block**
{% endhint %}

&#x20;The content can be added or removed with the content blocks, such as Menu, Custom HTML, Social media, Subscription, Copyright, and Payments.&#x20;

&#x20;Now let´s take a quick glance at each of these blocks.

## Menu

&#x20;The block “Menu” allows you to add menu items, which you would like to have in the Footer. You can give this block a **Title**, which will make it easier to distinguish one menu block from another. In order to add content, you need to select a page in **“Menu”** , e.g.: SHOP, INFORMATION, ORDER. Make sure, that this page was created in the _Navigation_ of your _Shopify Admin_. How to do that you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page).&#x20;

&#x20;The name of the page will be shown in the footer if you enable the option **“Show title on the desktop”.** You can change the column size of this menu block using a **“Column size”** scale from 0 to 12, where 0 is a default size. One can also decide, in how many rows the menu items should be displayed, using the **“Rows limit”** scale from 0 to 20, where 0 means the disabling of the limit. You can add such “Menu” blocks as many as you need. In our example, we have added 3 “Menu” blocks to the footer type #7: SHOP, INFORMATION, ORDER. In the menu block “Shop” we have the following settings:

**Column size:** 12

**Rows limit:** 3 (this limit allows us to have only 3 rows for the menu items in the “Shop” menu).&#x20;

## Custom html

&#x20;This block allows you to add a page as a content. You may give it a title, which will be the block title, and will be displayed on the desktop. If you don´t want this title to be displayed on the desktop, simply disable the option **“Show title on the desktop”.** Then select a page in the **“Page content”.** Make sure, that this page was created in the Navigation of your Shopify Admin. How to do that you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page). If no page was selected, a default page “Include footer Custom HTML” will be displayed. You can edit this page in the _Navigation_ of your _Shopify Admin_. In our example, we will add the block “Custom HTML” to the footer type #7, give it the title “Here to help” and leave the default page as a page content for the footer:&#x20;

## Social media

&#x20;In this block, you can decide what social media labels should be displayed in your footer. You may give it a title, which will be the block title, and will be displayed on the desktop. In our example, we have given this block a title “Follow us” and have enabled all possible social media labels for the footer type #7:&#x20;

## Subscription

&#x20;If you need to have a subscription section, you can add a block “Subscription”. Here you can decide what should be written in the title, paragraph, placeholder, and button text. In our example, we have added the following text in the block “Subscription” for the footer type #7:

**Title:** Newsletter subscription

**Paragraph:** Sign up for Shella updates to receive information about new arrivals, future events, and specials.

**Placeholder:** Enter Your Email Address

**Button text:** SUBSCRIBE!&#x20;

## Copyright

&#x20;This block enables you to add your copyright. You just need to select a page in the “Page content”. If no page is selected, a default page “Include Footer Copyright” will be used by the theme. Of course, the content of this page can be edited with your information in the _Navigation_ in your _Shopify Admin_. How to edit a page you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page). In our example, we have left the default page “Include Footer Copyright” for the footer type #7:&#x20;

## Payments

&#x20;If you need to configure payment icons for the Footer, navigate to _Theme settings -> Payments -> Footer._ More about payment icons you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/theme-settings/payments).

## Colorize

&#x20;Here one can configure color settings for Footer elements, such as: background, text, titles, icons etc.&#x20;
