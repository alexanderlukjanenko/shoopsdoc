# Pre-loader

{% hint style="info" %}
**Theme settings -> Pre-loader**
{% endhint %}

&#x20;This option enables you to show a page pre-loader every time the customer clicks on any new page in your store and waits a couple of seconds until the page loads. You can make this waiting process more useful by adding an image as a pre-loader:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_34 (3).png>)

&#x20;Additionally, you can change the page pre-loader image anytime you want or remove it if you donÂ´t need this option. The image can be customized by choosing the proper size on the size scale from 50 to 400 px, and by changing a background opacity on the scale from 0.0 to 1.0.
