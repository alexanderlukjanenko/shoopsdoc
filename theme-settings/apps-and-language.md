# Apps & Language

{% hint style="info" %}
**Theme settings -> Apps & Language**
{% endhint %}

## General

### Load jQuery first

&#x20;The option “Load jQuery first” is required for some translation apps. Once your translation app doesn´t work, you need to enable this option. If this option is disabled, the page load speed will be better.

## Language

### Language app

&#x20;Shella theme has an option “Language app”. Here you have a dropdown list, which offers you to choose the translation app you use for your store and which is compatible with Shella theme, links list, and none. Now let´s talk about each option.

*   **Store languages (Default)**

    Default Shopify behaviour\
    Go to _Online store -> Themes -> Theme actions -> Edit languages_ to manage the active language and edit texts.
*   **Weglot**

    Shella theme already includes the code needed for the Weglot app. You should install the Weglot app at _Shopify Admin -> Apps_.
*   **Links list**

    This option can be used only if your store has several websites for each language and the domain of your stores differs only in language, e.g.: abc.com/at, abc.com/en, abc.com/de. Here you need to create a navigation menu with the links to each of the stores so that when the customers want to change the language for example from English to German, they will be redirected to your german store when clicking on German. To do so go to your _Shopify Admin -> Navigation -> Add menu_. Then write a title for this menu, and add a menu item with the name e.g. German and paste a link to your German store. Repeat the action if you have the websites of your store in different languages.
*   **None**

    The language dropdown list will not be shown in the header, once you choose this option.

## Klarna app

&#x20;The option **"Enable Klarna app"** activates this app on your store. Additionally, you can add the app content and a tab for an app to the product page. In order to show the app content and create a tab, navigate to _Products -> Product page and press “Add block”_. How to configure the Klarna app for your store, you can read **** [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.ticksy.com/article/17058/).

## Growave app

&#x20;The option "Enable Growave App" allows you to activate using the app.
