This is how it looks like:

### **Icon for a 'Cart' button**

&#x20;In this section, you have the possibility to change the icon for the “Сart” button using a snippet for an icon, which you can find **** [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://shella-demo.myshopify.com/pages/icons).

### **Enable bar**

&#x20;If you enable this option, a free shipping progress bar will be shown at the end of the cart page.

### **Free shipping value**

&#x20;Here you can set a free shipping value. Set a free shipping limit in cents. If you offer free shipping on orders more than 50 USD, set 5000 here. Once the client adds products to a cart with a total price greater than or equal to 50 USD, a free shipping progress bar will appear at the end of the cart page, if you enabled this bar above.

**Multi currency**

&#x20;Set a free shipping values for different currencies, using the separator “|”.

&#x20;For e.g., if you use three currencies for your store. You can add three values according to the list of currencies in the dropdown menu:

### **Default country selection**

&#x20;Here you can write a country, which should be shown as a default delivery country when calculating the shipping rates.

&#x20;**Example:** If your store is in United States and your main customers are from United States, then write “United States” and it will be shown automatically in the dropdown list when calculating the delivery rates. Of course, if your store offers delivery to different countries, the clients can choose any other country from the list, but the default (main one) will be United States in this example:
