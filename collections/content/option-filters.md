## **Section settings**

&#x20;You can give this block a **“Title”** and choose its **“Default state”**: open, close, fixed or without a title. ****&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note**, once you select the option **“Top & vertical filters”** in _Theme settings -> Collection page -> Sidebar position on desktop_, only options “Open” and “Close” can be available and only for mobile mode. On the desktop view, filters will be displayed as closed by default. How to configure the sidebar position, you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/theme-settings/collection-page-1#sidebar-position-on-desktop).
{% endhint %}

## **Content**

&#x20;**** Here you may set the design of filter items. If shown as text list with checkboxes, or as color swatches. If you enable the option **“Show checkbox area”**, the checkboxes for color items will be shown. In order to display color variants as circle colors rather than as a text list, enable the option **“Make as color circle”**. **Please note**, this option works only with the ticked **“Show checkbox area”**.

&#x20;In the **“Tags list”** you can write the items, that should be shown in the filter for the checkmark. The items can be separated simply by breaking the line.

&#x20;In the **“Layout”** you can choose how the tags should be displayed: in rows or in columns.\
&#x20;On the **“Max column size”** scale from 0 to 30, you can choose how many items should be shown in one column. **Please note**, the scale settings can be used if the limit of columns set to 2 or 3 columns in the “Layout” dropdown. If you choose 0, the filter items will be displayed on a scroll or in a column. In the **“Section visible on collections”** you can decide on which collection pages this “Tag” block should be shown. All you need is just to **write a handle** of the collection**.** If there are several collections, please add a handle using a separator '|'. Example: 'men-s|women-s'. If you do not write anything in this field this “Tag” block will be displayed on all collections by default. Where to find a handle, you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-find-a-handle).
