# Filter settings

{% hint style="info" %}
**Collections -> Product grid -> Add block -> Filter settings**
{% endhint %}

## &#x20;Filter settings

&#x20;In the **“Filter name”**, type to which filter this block will be assigned:

## &#x20;Section settings

You can give this block a **“Title”** and choose its **“Default state”**: open, close, fixed or without a title.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note**, once you select the option **“Top & vertical filters”** in _Theme settings -> Collection page -> Sidebar position on desktop_, only options “Open” and “Close” can be available and only for mobile mode. On the desktop view, filters will be displayed as closed by default. How to configure the sidebar position, you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/theme-settings/collection-page-1#sidebar-position-on-desktop).
{% endhint %}

## Content

&#x20;If you want to display color variants as circle colors rather than as a text list, enable the option **“Make as color circle”**. **Please note**, this option works only for color variants.

&#x20;In the **“Layout”** dropdown, one can choose the columns limit for filters: 1, 2, 3 columns or row. On the **“Max column size”** scale **** from 0 to 30, you can choose how many items should be shown in one column. **Please note**, the scale settings can be used if the limit of columns set to 2 or 3 columns in the “Layout” dropdown. If you choose 0, the filter items will be displayed on a scroll or in a column.
