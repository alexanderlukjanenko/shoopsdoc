# Theme Blocks

&#x20;No matter what header type you have chosen, its content can be changed individually in the Shella theme. You can change the content of the header using different dynamic blocks when adding new content. There are several blocks for the header: Title images, Labels, Icons (for the first level), Info line, Tape, Mega menu, Mega -> Promo box, Mega -> Brands, Mega -> Products, Mega -> Custom HTML, Mega -> Subscription, Advanced menu (4 levels). You can find them all when clicking on “Add block”:

![](../.gitbook/assets/header\_blocks.png)

&#x20;Now let's take a deep look at each content block.

## Title images

&#x20;“Title images” block enables you to add images to the titles of subsections in the Mega menu. For example, in the main menu there is a section Men´s. When one hovers the mouse over it, the Men´s Mega menu is displayed, where various subsections and promo boxes may be shown. In our example, the subsections are clothing, shoes, and accessories.

&#x20;Now if we want the title of the subsections to have images we **add the block** **“Title images”**, where images can be added to up to 5 items. If you have less than five subsections, leave the other ones blank. In order to **add a title image for the item #1**, we type **“Men's+Clothing”**, then we **select the desired image for Image #1**, additionally, we can **change the size of the image** on the size scale from 100 to 300 px. We have added 3 images to each subsection and this is what we have got:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_1 (3).png>)

## Labels

&#x20;If you need a special label, e.g. NEW, HOT, SALE to be shown near the title of the subsection you have to add a block “Labels”. In this block, you can add labels to 15 items. If this is not enough for you, you can add more blocks “Labels”. Now let's go deeper into this block.

#### **Type**

&#x20;The block “Labels” has 3 label types: NEW, HOT, SALE, which can be chosen from the dropdown list. Each label has its color: new - blue, hot - orange, sale - red. Once you choose any label out of this list, it will be shown in front of each item you add to “For item #1 - #15” in this block. For each new type a new “Labels” block is required.

#### **Text**

&#x20;If you need another label for your item, which is not offered in the types, you can write the name of the label in the text field. No matter what name of the “Type” was selected, it will be automatically changed to your label text using the original type’s color, e.g.: Active now!

#### **For item #1 - #15**

&#x20;In these fields you need to write for which title the label is required, e.g.: Men's+Shoes+Flats.

Example:

&#x20;In our example we have set the following labels:

**NEW** - for Women's+Clothing+Coats

**HOT** - for Women's+Shoes+Heels

**SALE** - for Women's+Shoes+Trainers

**HURRY UP!** - for Women's+Accessories+Bags (Although the Type here is “Sale” we have written our own label text “HURRY UP!” in the Text field and only the original color of the label type “Sale” remains, but the text is different.)&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_2 (4).png>)

## Icons (For the first level)

&#x20;If you want each menu section to have an icon, you need to add the block “Icons”. The icons can be added both for horizontal and for vertical menu. The icon codes you can find [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://shella-demo.myshopify.com/pages/icons).

#### **For vertical menu**

&#x20;If you enable the option **“For vertical menu”** the icons will be added to the vertical menu only.

#### **For item #1 - #20**

&#x20;In these fields you need to write for which Menu item the icon is required, e.g.: Layouts, Shop, Blog.

#### Icon **#1 - #20**

&#x20;In this block you can add up to 20 icons. If this is not enough for you, you can add another block “Icons (For the first level)”.

### EXAMPLE of the icons in the vertical menu:

**For item #1**

Women's

**Icon #1**

icon-theme-050

**For item #2**

Men's

**Icon #2**

icon-theme-048

**For item #3**

## Info line

&#x20;This block allows you to add additional information to the very top of the header, e.g.: call us, phone number, etc. The block “Info line” can be added only once!&#x20;

#### Show block on mobile

&#x20;If you want to show the Info line on mobile, simply enable an option  **“Show block on mobile”.**

#### Colorize style

&#x20;Here you can decide what colorize stile will be displayed for an Info line both on desktop and mobile view. The theme included two colorize styles:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Style #1" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_4 (3).png>)


{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Style #2" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_5 (4).png>)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Enable transparent background

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note**, this functionality works with the enabled **“Transparent background”** in the **“Header”** section. Check details [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/header#transparent-background).
{% endhint %}

&#x20;If you enable the option, it will only apply to the Home page. The information line will have an additional background on other pages or when hover over header lines on a Home page. Background of an information line can be changed by selecting it's Colorize style (read the details above) or by adding the dynamic block **“Colorize”** to the “Header” section. How to configure colors especially for the Info line, you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/header/content#info-line-block).

#### Page content

&#x20;In order to add the page content, you need to select the page with the proper information. If no page is selected, the default page “Include Header Info Line” will be used. In the Shella theme there are some default pages, which you can edit with your information.

&#x20;You can edit the pages in your _Shopify Admin-> Online Store -> Pages._ Then click on the page and edit it with your information:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_11 (8).png>)

&#x20;More information about how to add and edit pages you can find [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page).

#### Show social media

&#x20;In case you need the social media to be displayed in the Info line, you should tick the option **“Show social media”** before to start choosing media from the suggested list.

### Media Settings

&#x20;You can also decide, whether social media should be displayed in your Info line if you have any from the suggested list in **“Media settings”**. Please note, that the links to your social media accounts should be added in your _Shella Admin -> Theme settings -> Social Media -> Social accounts._

## Announcement bar

&#x20;An announcement bar is sort of an information line at the very top of the header which can be closed by the customer. It can be added only once.&#x20;

#### Delayed appearance

&#x20;Here you can decide if you want to delay the appearance of the Tape by using the scale from 0 to 10 second of the delay.

#### Colorize style

&#x20;In this block, you can choose the Tape colorize style. There are 3 colorize styles:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Style #1" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_6 (3).png>)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Style #2" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_9 (3).png>)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Style #3" %}
![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_8 (4).png>)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Enable transparent background

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note**, this functionality works with the enabled **“Transparent background”** in the **“Header”** section. Check details [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/header#transparent-background).
{% endhint %}

&#x20;If you enable the option, it will only apply to the Home page. The tape will have an additional background on other pages or when hover over header lines on a Home page. Background of the announcement bar can be changed by selecting it's Colorize style (read the details above) or by adding the dynamic block **“Colorize”** to the “Header” section . How to configure colors for the announcement bar, you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/header/content#announcement-bar-block).

#### Text or HTML content

&#x20;You can always change its content by writing a new text or HTML content, and of course, the tape can be always removed as a content block.

## Mega Menu

&#x20;A mega menu block allows you to organize and customize the menu items, inside of the dropdown menu section. This is a multifunctional block, which enables one to add additional content, such as promo-boxes, brands, products, etc. Before you start working with the Mega menu block, make sure, that you have created all menu items needed for this menu section in your _Shopify Admin -> Navigation._ How to add and edit menu items in your online store you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/legacy/menus-and-links/editing-menus)**.**

&#x20; We will show you how it may look on an example of the “Women’s” menu.

&#x20; These were our steps:

1. In the **Navigation**, we have **added a menu item “Main menu”:** &#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_19 (7).png>)

&#x20;   2\. In the **“Main menu”** we have added all needed menu items including a menu item **“Women’s”.**

&#x20;   3\. In **“Women’s”** we have added some other menu items with the dropdown menus:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_20 (6).png>)

&#x20;Now we can get back to the “Mega menu” block in the Shella theme and customize it.

### **General**

&#x20;Here are some general settings for the mega menu. In the field **“For item”**, you should type the name of the menu item, for which the mega menu is created. Check the following [<mark style="color:blue;">**video tutorial**</mark>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqKAQ5yRSYQ\&list=PLj-506KaR\_vcQjwcpC6yII-1JY0bSj7df\&index=5) **** for the example, how to customize a mega menu block.

In our example, we have used the “Women's” item.

&#x20;Since we have already added the blocks “Title images” before (check the example [<mark style="color:blue;">**above**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/header/content#title-images)), we can customize the size of their columns on the size scale **“Links column size”** from 1 to 12:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_10 (3).png>)

#### **Second level is a column**

&#x20;If you enable this option, the menu items in the second level will be displayed like this:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_11 (4).png>)

#### **Column lines limit**

&#x20;This option enables you to decide how many lines of the menu items should be displayed in one row. There is a scale, where you can change the number of lines from 1 to 50.&#x20;

#### **Wrap menu columns to grid**

&#x20;This option enables you to order all the menu columns in one block:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_12 (2).png>)

### **Additional content on the left**

&#x20;This section allows you to customize a content for the promo box in the left column. Here you can decide how many items should be displayed in one row of promo box on the left side by choosing the **“Content type”**. A column size can also be selected on the **“Column size”** scale from 0 to 12. How to add a promo box you can read in the block Mega -> Promo box.

### **Additional content on the right**

&#x20;This section allows you to customize a content for the promo box in the right column. Here you can decide how many items should be displayed in one row of promo box on the right side by choosing the **“Content type”**. A column size can also be selected on the **“Column size”** scale from 0 to 12. How to add a promo box you can read in the block Mega -> Promo box.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_13 (3).png>)

### **Vertical menu only**

&#x20;This section can be used only for the “Header type” #5 and Header type” #7. If you want to limit the edge of the menu container, tick the option **“Enable width limit”** and use the **“Width limit”** scale from 300 to 1000 px.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_1 (1).png>)

## Mega -> Promo box

&#x20;Promo box is an additional option for the mega menu. It enables you to add a promotion (banner), brands, products, pages, etc. inside of the dropdown menu. From the previous section you might have known that the columns for promo boxes can be positioned both on the left and on the right sides in the dropdown menu. You can also choose only one side for this purpose. It is up to you. Now let's check on the example, how one can work with the promo box and how it may look like. In the block “Mega menu” we have created a mega menu for the “Men's”. We will proceed with working with this menu item. A new content block for the Mega menu “Men's” will be added. This content block is called Mega -> Promo box.

#### **Title**

&#x20;Here you can write a title of the banner that will be displayed above the banner´s image in the promo box. This is optional, of course.

### **General**

&#x20;In this section you can add a **“URL for the banner”** that will redirect your customers to the needed page, when clicking on the banner. Simply click on it and choose the desired page from the dropdown list, or you can paste a link that is not on this list.

### **Image**

&#x20;In order to make your banner more attractive for the clients, you can add an **“Image”** for it. The recommended image size is 1440 x 550 pixels. The size of the image can be changed on the **“Image size”** scale from 200 to 2000 pixels. You can also add an **“Image mask”** and choose the level of its opacity on the **“Image mask opacity”** scale from 0.1 to 1.0. An image mask is sort of the color cover which can be put over the image in order to give it a particular shade of color if it has some opacity, or to cover it completely with the color if the opacity level is at maximum.

### **Text**

&#x20;Here you customize the text content for your banner in the promo box. There are 3 text lines that can be added. Delete the line value for the text or button if you want to hide the element and use "\<br>" for a line break. Of course the style of the text content can be changed in **“Colorized style”**, where you can choose one of eight possible styles for this purpose.

### **Button #1 - #2**

&#x20;For each banner in the promo box you can add two buttons, which can be customized. There are three customization options for the buttons: button text, URL for the button, and button style. In the button text you can write the title of the button, e.g.: Shop now, or More. In the URL for the button insert the link to which the client should be redirected when clicking on the button and in the button style you can choose one of the button styles which are offered in the dropdown list.

### **Other content**

**List**&#x20;

&#x20;In order to add a page with a list content for the banner, press “Select page” and choose the one from the list. You can create a list content in your **** _Shopify admin -> Pages_.

**Custom HTML**

&#x20;This option allows you to replace the whole text content in the promo box with the page content. How to add and edit a page you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page). This is an example of it:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_13 (9).png>)

### **Layout**

&#x20;Here you can choose the **Type** of layout for the text in the promo box. Shella theme offers a lot of types for the layout, simply choose the one, that suits best for your store. Additionally, you can choose the proper **“Content position on the desktop”** and **“Content horizontal align”.**

### **Animation**

&#x20;In this section you can work on the animation, position, and opacity of the image in the banner of your promo box. You can decide whether the image should have an animation when being hovered over with the mouse cursor by choosing the proper option from **“Moving image on hover to”**. The positioning of the image can also be set in the **“Static image position”**. Just choose one of the available options from the dropdown list. In the same way you can decide whether or when the banner image in the promo box should have an opacity. In the dropdown list **“Image opacity”** the options static, hover, static, and hover or none can be chosen for this purpose.

### **EXAMPLE Promo box (OTHER CONTENT SETTINGS)**

&#x20;Now let’s see what we get when we add and customize our Promo box for the Mega menu “Men’s”. If we don't use an option, we leave it blank. So, these are our settings for the Promo box:

**Title:** (no title was written)

GENERAL

**URL for banner:** All Collections

**Image:** (the image was selected)

**Image size:** 400px

**Image mask:** red

**Image mask opacity:** 0.3

TEXT

**Text line #1:** Sale

**Text line #2:** -20% OFF

**Colorize style:** Style #1

OTHER CONTENT

**List:** (not selected)

**Custom HTML:** (not selected)

LAYOUT

**Type:** Type #3 (Ribbon bottom the image) **Please note!** For this type no buttons will be shown!

ANIMATION

**Move image on hover to:** Center

**Static image position:** None

**Image opacity:** None

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Please note!** In “Mega menu” block (that we have described above) you can choose on which side the banner will be positioned: right or left. The number of banner items in one row can also be chosen in Mega menu.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

&#x20;For our example we have the following settings:

LEFT COLUMN

**Content type:** 1 item in row

**Column size:** 0/12

RIGHT COLUMN

**Content type:** none

**Column size:** 0/12

&#x20;We have also deleted the block “Title images” in order to concentrate your attention on the “Promo box” block only.

&#x20;So after all these settings, we have got the following dropdown menu for the menu item “Men’s”:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_2 (1).png>)

## Mega -> Brands

&#x20;You can add brands in the right or in the left column of the dropdown menu the same as banners of promo box and customize them, writing their title, pasting an URL for the title, choosing how many images should be displayed in one row. Moreover you can add images for brands and resize them, using a scale for image size from 50 to 300 px. For each image an URL can be selected. In one such “Mega -> Brands” block you can add up to 10 images for brands and customize them.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT!** The positioning of the blocks is very important! If you want to see “Mega -> Brands” block in the dropdown menu (e.g. for “Women´s”), the blocks should have the following order:

1. Mega menu (For item “Women´s”)
2. Mega -> Brands
3. Title images
{% endhint %}

&#x20;We will show you an example of such a block in the menu item “Women´s” where we have the following settings:

**Title:** Top Brands

**URL for title:** All collections

GENERAL

**Size of images:** 2 images in a row

IMAGES

**Image #1:** (an image was added)

**Image size #1:** 80px

**Content type:** 1 item in row

**Column size:** 4/12

## Mega -> Products

&#x20;You can add products in the right or in the left column of the dropdown menu same as banners of promo box or brands and customize them, writing their title; selecting the proper collection, from which the products should be shown; choosing how many images should be displayed in one row, using the dropdown menu **“Products per row”**, and selecting the number of products on the **“Rows”** - scale from 1 to 6.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT!** The positioning of the blocks is very important! If you want to see “Mega -> Products” block in the dropdown menu (e.g. for “Men´s”), the blocks should have the following order:

**For item:** Gallery

And this is what we´ve got:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/header\_4 levels.png>)

&#x20;Make sure, that you have created a menu for the item in Shopify Admin first. This is how the advanced menu looks like in Shopify Admin:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/header\_4 levels\_admin.png>)
