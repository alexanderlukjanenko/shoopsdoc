# Theme blocks

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**Products -> Product page - Add block**
{% endhint %}

&#x20;There are 2 blocks that can be added and edited in the sidebar: **“Sidebar products”** and **“Sidebar custom HTML”** blocks.&#x20;

&#x20;If you want to add additional blocks for the tabs use the block **“Tab for custom content”**.&#x20;

&#x20;If you need to have the Klarna app functionality on product pages, the blocks **“Klarna App content”** and **“Tab for Klarna App”** should be added. You can activate the option in _Theme settings -> Apps & Language -> Klarna App_. How to configure the Klarna app, you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.ticksy.com/article/17058/).

&#x20;Let’s get deeper into each of these blocks.

## **Theme Blocks**

## **Klarna App**

&#x20;**** If you need a section and a tab, add the blocks **“Klarna App content”** and **“Tab for Klarna App”**. In each block, one can apply settings for any class to the **“Class name”** field.&#x20;

&#x20;Here you can have several blocks and give them different classes. ****&#x20;

## **Tab for custom content**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**IMPORTANT!** Tabs which you can customize in the Shella Editor work for all Product pages. If you want to add a **unique Tab for each product**, you can achieve it via Metafields. How to add and edit custom tabs you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/product-metafields).
{% endhint %}

&#x20;If you want to add an additional tab under the product, you need to add a content block **“Tab for custom content”**. Here you can write the **Title** of the tab and its content in **“HTML”** field. If you want to have a page as content in the tab, select a page in the **“Page content”**, that should be displayed in the tab. How to add and edit a page you can read [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started/how-to-add-and-edit-a-page)**.**

&#x20;**** In our example, we selected a default page 'Include Product Tab Custom HTML' and this is what we have got:&#x20;

## Sidebar products

&#x20;In this block you can add a **Title** to the products, that will be shown in the sidebar. In the **“Collection”** you can select the collection that should be shown in the product’s page sidebar, e.g.: “Featured products”. How to add and edit a collection you can read **** [<mark style="color:blue;">**here**</mark>](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/collections). On the **“Max count”** scale from 0 to 10 products you can decide how many products should be displayed in the sidebar. In the **“Products type”** you can choose the size of the products that will be displayed in the sidebar. It may be either full or short.

## Sidebar custom HTML

&#x20;This block enables you to add an additional page in the sidebar. In this block you can select the page, that you want to be displayed in the sidebar, e.g.: “About our store”.

&#x20;This is an example of the sidebar with the block “Sidebar products”, where we have added “Featured products” and the block “Sidebar custom HTML”, where we have added a page “About our store”:&#x20;
