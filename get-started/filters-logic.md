# Filters logic

### Filters logic

'AND' - shows products that has all selected attributes. 'Black' AND 'XXL'. Narrow filter results.

'OR' - shows products that has at least one selected attribute. 'Black' OR 'XXL'. Wide filter results.

#### What are tags?

Tags are keywords for the product. They describe the product in detail so that the system can find the needed product for the customer using a filter, e.g.: Zara, Women, Vintage, Trainers, T-Shirts & Tanks, Sunglasses, Summer etc. You can find tags in Shopify Admin -> Products -> All Products. Choose any product and click on it. More information about how to create and use tags in Shopify you can find [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/productivity-tools/using-tags).

#### How tags can affect the filter?

The filters by tags use the filter logic "AND" by default.

**A filter logic “AND”**

This filter logic includes only products with all tags, 'tag1' and 'tag2' in a filtering results.

Example:

There is a T-shirt with the following tags: Red, White, Blue M, S, L, Zara, T-Shirt, Summer.

There is a jacket with the following tags: Green, Red, 34, 36, 38, Armani, Autumn.

There is a hat with the following tags: Black, Silver, One size, Gucchi, Summer.

Now, the customer is searching for red, summer products. The system will show only a T-shirt to him, because only this product has both “red” and “summer” tags.

#### A filter logic “OR”

This filter logic includes in filter results all products  all selected attributes.

Example:

There is a T-shirt with the following tags: Red, White, Blue M, S, L, Zara, T-Shirt, Summer.

There is a jacket with the following tags: Green, Red, 34, 36, 38, Armani, Autumn.

There is a hat with the following tags: Black, Silver, One size, Gucchi, Summer.

Now, the customer is searching for green, Gucchi products. The system will show him both products: a jacket (because it has a “green” tag) and a hat (because it has a “Gucchi” tag).
