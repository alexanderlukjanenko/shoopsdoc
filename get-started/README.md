## Update theme

&#x20;Usually, the theme files are edited by webmasters or apps. Major theme updates include a lot of changes. That is why it is not easy task to update the theme.

&#x20;All the theme versions are tested before release. Update to the latest version is not obligatory. You may stay with your current version.

&#x20;You can review [<mark style="color:blue;">change log</mark>](https://themeforest.net/item/shella-ultimate-fashion-responsive-shopify-theme/22804833#item-description\_\_change-log) at [<mark style="color:blue;">**Themeforest description page**</mark>](https://themeforest.net/item/shella-ultimate-fashion-responsive-shopify-theme/22804833).

&#x20;If you have a highly customized store or want to install a major theme update, I recommend starting from scratch. Please note, a major update is from version 1 to version 3, or from version 2 to version 3. A minor update is from version 3.1.x to 3.3.x. A bugfix update is from 3.3.1 to 3.3.4.

&#x20;The following update process is good for minor and bug fix updates.

&#x20;The update process is similar to the installation process with additional steps - export/import theme settings.

1.  &#x20;Duplicate your current theme _Online store -> Themes -> Actions -> Duplicate_.

    This is a backup copy in case something went wrong.
2. Upload the latest theme version to your store. Check [<mark style="color:blue;">**Install theme**</mark>](https://mpithemes.gitbook.io/shella-shopify-theme/get-started#install-theme) for more details.
3. Navigate to _Shopify admin -> Apps -> ExIm app -> Theme settings_. In the section "Export", select the theme to export theme settings:

&#x20;     4\. In the "Import" section, select the destination theme to import the downloaded theme settings -> press "Add file" -> select the exported Archive -> press "Import theme settings":     &#x20;

&#x20;   5\. Check app configuration. Perform installation steps if needed.

&#x20;   6\. Apply custom code changes. If your store has it.

### Theme settings <a href="#theme-settings" id="theme-settings"></a>

&#x20;_Online Store -> Themes -> Customize -> Theme settings_ - this is the first location where you should look for theme options.

&#x20;Here you can change general theme setting, which applies to all store pages.

&#x20;Logo, Typography, Colors, Layout, etc. All options have description and should be clear for you. If you don't find needed option try to search in sections.

&#x20;These sections available only at Home page. You can build a unique home page for your store using dynamic sections.

&#x20;Shella theme includes many dynamic sections like Product carouse, Collections, One product, Brands carousel, Article carousel, Builder.

&#x20;Builder section is most powerful. It has many block types. You can set custom width per each block. Banners (Promo boxes), Sliders, Instagram, etc.

&#x20;You can change sections options at _Online Store -> Themes -> Customize -> Sections_. You can remove static sections.

### Page sections <a href="#page-sections" id="page-sections"></a>

&#x20;This is most hard to find sections. They are unique per product page. You should first navigate to needed page to see static sections available for this page.

&#x20;For example: 'Product Page' and 'Related products carousel' sections for product pages. 'Sidebar' and 'Head' sections for collection pages.
