# Social media

{% hint style="info" %}
**Others -> Password -> Content -> Add Social media**
{% endhint %}

&#x20;Here you can decide whether social media should be displayed on a Password page, right after the subscription form. Tick each item in the suggested list **“Social media”** to display each one on your store.  Please note, that the links to your social media accounts should be added in your _Shella Admin -> Theme settings -> Social Media -> Social accounts._&#x20;
